    <h2>Discription</h2>
    <p>A simple chicken and red wine recipe with a tasty sauce made 
        from brown sugar, garlic, paprika, salt, and pepper. Everything 
        balanced together makes this dish comforting and yummy! Braised 
        chicken breasts, brazenly good taste.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>3 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup red wine</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook 
            garlic in oil until tender.</li>
        <li>Place chicken in the skillet, and cook for about 10 minutes 
            on each side, until no longer pink and juices run clear. An 
            instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should 
            read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Drain oil from the skillet. Sprinkle chicken with paprika 
            and brown sugar.</li>
        <li>Pour red wine around chicken. Cover and simmer, 15 to 20 
            minutes; lightly baste the chicken with wine sauce while 
            cooking. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
    </ol>
