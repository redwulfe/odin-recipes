    <h2>Discription</h2>
    <p>This easy cheesy lasagna recipe is a simple lasagna that 
        takes about half the effort of traditional versions. I 
        always make extra for leftovers, but the more I cook, 
        the more they eat! Serve with garlic toast and salad.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 pound bulk Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced black olives</li>
        <li>½ cup warm water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried onion flakes</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried sage</li>
        <li>1 pinch dry basil</li>
        <li>2 (14 ounce) jars marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>8 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 pound mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Cook ground beef and Italian sausage in a large 
            skillet over medium-high heat until browned and 
            crumbled; drain excess grease. Stir in olives and 
            water; season with minced garlic, oregano, onion 
            flakes, garlic powder, pepper, sage, and basil. 
            Simmer, stirring frequently, about 15 minutes. 
            Stir in marinara sauce and remove from the heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Spoon a layer of meat and sauce on the bottom of a 
            9x13 inch baking dish. Cover with a layer of dry 
            noodles. Spread a thin layer of ricotta cheese over 
            noodles; sprinkle with some mozzarella cheese. Cover 
            with another layer of sauce; repeat layering, ending 
            with meat and sauce on top. Reserve about 1/2 cup 
            mozzarella cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, checking 
            after 30 minutes. Lasagna is cooked when it's easily 
            pierced with a knife. Sprinkle reserved mozzarella 
            cheese over lasagna and bake until melted, about 10 
            minutes more.
        </li>
